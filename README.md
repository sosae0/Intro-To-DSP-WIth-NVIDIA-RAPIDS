# Intro-To-DSP-With-NVIDIA-RAPIDS
This is an introductory notebook to Digital Signal Processing(DSP) using CuSignal and other NVIDIA RAPIDS open-source API

For the GPU notebook, all the codes were run on paperspace(cloud based platform to access RAPIDS container) since I do not have an NVIDIA GPU locally

For the CPU notebook, I used an Apple M1 Pro laptop to run all codes.
